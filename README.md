## Welcome to Skytrack
# Our team has designed a web application that visualizes Earth-orbiting satellites in real time.
Users can view orbital parameters, satellite metadata, and predicted ground tracks for individual objects.
Data updates continuously, and objects can be filtered by operator, orbit type, or mission category.
